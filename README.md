# Sentiment-analysis
## This is my first pyhon program, sorry for the shitty format
### pip install nltk
### You can input a positive word at first an the program will return a bunch of synonyms as well as antonyms. (If the it returns "set()" means that the set is empty, try another positive word)
### The program will output the sentiment score of the sentence. 1 <= s(d) <= -1
### This program uses 15 comments in the "comments.txt". They are seperated by '\n'.
